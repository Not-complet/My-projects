        <p> One reason I video games is how video games can take you any while your still in control. For example, games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Overwatch can take you decades into the future where the technology is very advanced. Another reason is how video games can help you in the real world. As an example, recent research says that video games can help you see better, learn more quickly, and develop greater mental focus. And that's just the start of it. </p>

        <p>Ari Gibson(left) and William Pellan(right) are the creators of one of my favorite games Hollow Knight. The reason why I put them here is because of how polished their game was and how they think of quality over quantity. Their company, Team Cherry, has only one game and it's one of the best metroidvania games in the world! </p>
